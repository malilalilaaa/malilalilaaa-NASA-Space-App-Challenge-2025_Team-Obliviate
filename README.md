🌍 NovaSense — See the Unseen, Learn the Unknown

NovaSense is an app built by Team Obliviate that uses AI + NASA data to help people understand Earth better and prepare for disasters.

It transforms complicated satellite signals into easy-to-understand information, personalized safety alerts, and fun learning experiences. NovaSense empowers students, scientists, and communities to take action with knowledge that can save lives.

🚀 HOW WE MET THE CHALLENGE

Our challenge was to translate Earth's secret language. NASA's satellites see life-saving warnings about floods, fires, and earthquakes, but this information is often locked away in complex code, too difficult for most people to use.

Our answer is NovaSense, an app that unlocks this hidden language, turning complex radar signals into clear, actionable insights for everyone.

🌟 What the App Offers:

🔔 Live, Personalized Safety Alerts
Get immediate warnings for floods, fires, and earthquakes tailored to your location.
