🚀 HOW WE MET THE CHALLENGE

Our challenge was to translate Earth's secret language. NASA's satellites see life-saving warnings about floods, fires, and earthquakes, but this information is often locked away in complex code, too difficult for most people to use.

Our answer is NovaSense, an app that unlocks this hidden language, turning complex radar signals into clear, actionable insights for everyone.

🔔 Live, Personalized Safety Alerts
Get immediate warnings for floods, fires, and earthquakes tailored to your location.

🧩 Interactive Learning Adventures
Fun quizzes using real NASA data make learning a game. Stuck? Jump into the Knowledge Hub for simple science stories.

🛰️ Powerful Explorer Mode for Discovery
Students and researchers can upload data, use AR to analyze live surroundings, and collaborate globally.

🤖 On-Demand AI Explanations
An AI assistant explains complex concepts in simple terms whenever you need it.

📅 Daily Insights from NASA
Stay inspired with facts and stories about how satellites protect our planet.
